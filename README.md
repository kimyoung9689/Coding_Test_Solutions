Competitive Programming Solutions: Automated Problem Solving Repository
This repository serves as an automated hub for competitive programming solutions. It automatically syncs problem-solving code from various online coding platforms. Currently, it supports Baekjoon, with plans to expand to other platforms like Programmers in the future.

Project Goals
Automation: Efficiently manage problem-solving code by automatically importing it from various coding platforms.

Centralized Management: Systematically record and track solutions from multiple platforms in one place.

Skill Enhancement: Continuously improve algorithm and data structure proficiency through regular problem-solving.

Code Quality: Develop a habit of writing readable and efficient code.

```

Within each platform's directory (e.g., Baekjoon), you'll find folders organized by difficulty (e.g., Bronze, Silver). Inside these, individual problem folders (\[Problem_Number]_Problem_Name) contain the solution files (.py).

Tech Stack
Python: Used for problem-solving and automation scripts.

Git & GitHub: Utilized for version control and CI/CD workflows.

GitHub Actions: Powers the automated synchronization workflows.

Automated Synchronization Process
Solve Problem: Solve a problem on an online coding platform (currently Baekjoon).

Script Execution: An automation script (e.g., sync_platform.py) checks for new solutions on the platform.

Code Fetching: If new solutions are found, the script retrieves the code and places it into the designated directory structure.

GitHub Push: A GitHub Actions workflow automatically commits and pushes the changes to this repository.

Contribution Guide
This repository aims to automate problem-solving management. Feel free to contribute by suggesting improvements to the automation scripts, proposing new platform integrations, or enhancing existing code. Pull requests and issues are always welcome!
